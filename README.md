Tfh cell fraction and marker gene expression in healthy and tumor lung samples. The code goes in two parts, one for fraction estimation of immunocytes in LUAD samples from TCGA by Cibersortx, and the other for marker gene expression of T and B cells in lung and lymphnode samples from Kim et al. (2020 Nat Communications).
